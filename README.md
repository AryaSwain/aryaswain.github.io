### Eye for the Blind 
This project transforms visual content into audio descriptions to enhance accessibility for visually impaired individuals. The model processes an image, identifies its elements, and provides a descriptive audio output. For instance, an image of a person with a dog in a park might be narrated as:  
*"This image may contain a dog standing with a man surrounded by trees."*  
This feature bridges the gap between visual and non-visual communication, empowering users to understand and connect with visual content.

The project utilizes an attention-based encoder-decoder architecture where a CNN extracts image features and an attention mechanism dynamically focuses on relevant regions of the image. This context-aware approach enables the GRU-based decoder to generate accurate and sequential audio descriptions of the image contents, making visual data accessible to visually impaired users.
